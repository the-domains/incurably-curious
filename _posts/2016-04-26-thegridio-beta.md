thegrid.io 

I signed up for this many months ago, a new way of creating a website, using AI. I'm now on the beta testing, I haven't played with it hardly at all yet so can't really form an opinion, but my initial thoughts are that it's a bit too intuitive if that makes sense. It's like they're leaving too much out as you can only, for instance, want to type the post contents in to the screen where you enter content. I wonder if it will replace any of the other sites I have at the moment.
